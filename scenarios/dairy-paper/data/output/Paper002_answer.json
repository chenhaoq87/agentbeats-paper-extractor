    "abstract": "Ruminants, particularly dairy and beef cattle, contribute to climate change through mostly enteric methane emissions. Several mitigating options have been proposed, including the feed additive 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). The objectives of this study were to explain the variability in the mitigating effect of 3-NOP and to investigate the interaction between diet composition and 3-NOP dose, using meta-analytical approaches. Data from 13 articles (14 experiments) met the selection criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, and 48 treatment means were used for the analysis. Mean differences were calculated as 3-NOP treatment mean minus control treatment mean and then expressed as a percentage of the control mean. Three types of models were developed: (1) one including 3-NOP dose, overall mean, and individual covariate; (2) a combination of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 3-NOP dose, and overall mean; and (3) one selected model from all combinations of up to 5 covariates, which were compared using a leave-one-out cross validation method. Models including only 3-NOP dose resulted in a significant reduction of 32.7%, 30.9%, and 32.6% for CH 4  production (g/d), yield (g/kg dry matter intake), and intensity (g/kg energy-corrected milk), respectively, at an average 3-NOP dose of 70.5 mg/kg dry matter (DM). The greater the NDF content in the diet, the lower the reduction efficiency for a given 3-NOP dose. For 10 g/kg DM increase in NDF content from its mean (329 g of NDF/kg of DM) the 3-NOP effect on CH 4  production was impaired by 0.633%, the 3-NOP effect on CH 4  yield by 0.647%, and the 3-NOP effect on CH 4  intensity by 0.723%. The analysis based on leave-one-out cross validation showed an increase in NDF and crude fat content reduces efficacy of 3-NOP and an increase in 3-NOP dose increases efficacy. A 1% (10 g/kg) DM decrease in dietary NDF content from its mean may increase the efficacy of 3-NOP in reducing CH 4  production by 0.915%. A 1% (10 g/kg DM) decrease in dietary crude fat content from its mean enhances the efficacy of 3-NOP on CH 4  production by 3.080% at a given dose and NDF level. For CH 4  yield, next to 3-NOP dose, dietary NDF content and dietary crude fat content were included in the selected model, but also dietary starch content with an opposite direction to NDF and crude fat. The effect of 3-NOP dose on CH 4  intensity was similar to its effect on CH 4  production, whereas the effect of dietary NDF content was slightly lower. Expanding the previously published models with the newly available data published from trials since then improved model performance, hence demonstrating the value of regularly updating meta-analyses if a wider range of data becomes available.",
    "summary": "This meta-analysis quantifies how the feed additive 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) mitigates enteric methane emissions from dairy cattle and how this mitigation is modified by diet composition. Using 48 treatment means from 14 experiments, the authors develop regression equations that express the relative change in methane production (g/d), yield (g/kg DMI), and intensity (g/kg ECM) as a function of 3-NOP dose and dietary neutral detergent fiber, crude fat, and starch contents (all centered around their mean values in the database). The selected models show that increasing 3-NOP dose increases methane reduction, whereas higher dietary NDF and crude fat reduce 3-NOP efficacy and higher starch can enhance efficacy, providing practical guidance for optimizing diet formulation when using 3-NOP in dairy systems.",
