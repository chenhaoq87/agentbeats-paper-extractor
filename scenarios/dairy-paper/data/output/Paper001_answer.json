    "abstract": "Late blowing defect (LBD) is an important spoilage issue in semi-hard cheese, with the outgrowth of  Clostridium tyrobutyricum  spores during cheese aging considered to be the primary cause. Although previous studies have explored the microbial and physicochemical factors influencing the defect, a risk assessment tool that allows for improved and rational management of LBD is lacking. The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of LBD in Gouda cheese and evaluate different intervention strategies. The spore concentration distribution of butyric acid bacteria (BAB) in bulk tank milk was obtained from 8 dairy farms over 12 mo. The concentration of  C. tyrobutyricum  from raw milk to the end of aging was simulated based on Gouda brined for 2 d in saturated brine at 8\u0000b0C and aged at 13\u0000b0C. Predicted  C. tyrobutyricum  concentrations during aging and estimated concentration thresholds in cheese at onset of LBD were used to predict product loss due to LBD during a simulated 1-yr production. With the estimated concentration thresholds in cheese ranging from 4.36 to 4.46 log most probable number (MPN)/kg of cheese, the model predicted that 9.2% (\u0000b11.7%) of Gouda cheese showed LBD by d 60; cheeses predicted to show LBD at d 60 showed a mean pH of 5.39 and were produced with raw milk with a mean BAB spore count of 143 MPN/L. By d 90, 36.1% (\u0000b13.4%) of cheeses were predicted to show LBD, indicating that LBD typically manifests between d 60 and 90, which is consistent with observations from the literature and the cheese industry. Sensitivity analysis indicated that  C. tyrobutyricum  maximum growth rate as well as concentration threshold in cheese at onset of LBD are the most important variables, identifying key data needs for development of more accurate models. The implementation of microfiltration or bactofugation of raw milk (assumed to show 98% efficiency of spore removal) in our model prevented occurrence of LBD during the first 60 d of aging. Overall, our findings provide a framework for predicting the occurrence of LBD in Gouda as well as other cheeses and illustrate the value of developing digital tools for managing dairy product quality.",
    "summary": "This paper develops a Monte Carlo-based risk assessment model to predict the occurrence of late blowing defect (LBD) in Gouda cheese caused by outgrowth of Clostridium tyrobutyricum during aging. The model links (i) initial butyric acid bacteria spore concentrations in bulk tank milk, (ii) growth of C. tyrobutyricum in cheese as a function of temperature, pH, and water activity using a gamma-type secondary model for the specific growth rate, and (iii) calculated concentration thresholds with uncertainty at which LBD becomes apparent. The main growth module uses a Baranyi primary growth equation without lag phase for C. tyrobutyricum with a maximum concentration Nmax and a temperature-, pH-, and water-activity-dependent growth rate μ = γ(T) γ(pH) γ(aw) μmax. Gamma factors for T, pH, and aw are defined using cardinal parameter relationships, and water activity is related linearly to water-phase salt. The model is used to estimate the proportion of Gouda cheeses expected to exhibit LBD during aging under baseline and intervention scenarios (e.g., bactofugation, nitrate addition, lysozyme, bacteriocinogenic LAB, premium milk, or altered aging temperature).",
