    "abstract": "Numerous empirical and mechanistic models predicting methane (CH 4 ) production are available. The aim of this work was to evaluate the Molly cow model and the Nordic cow model Karoline in predicting CH 4  production in cattle using a data set consisting of 267 treatment means from 55 respiration chamber studies. The dietary and animal characteristics used for the model evaluation represent the range of diets fed to dairy and growing cattle. Feedlot diets and diets containing additives mitigating CH 4  production were not included in the data set. The relationships between observed and predicted CH 4  (pCH 4 ) were assessed by regression analysis using fixed and mixed model analysis. Residual analysis was conducted to evaluate which dietary factors were related to prediction errors. The fixed model analysis showed that the Molly predictions were related to the observed data (± standard error) as CH 4  (g/d) = 0.94 (±0.022) × pCH 4  (g/d) + 31 (±6.9) [root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) = 45.0 g/d (14.9% of observed mean), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.925]. The corresponding equation for the Karoline model was CH 4  (g/d) = CH 4  (g/d) = 0.98 (±0.019) × pCH 4  (g/d) + 7.0 (±6.0) [RMSPE = 35.0 g/d (11.6%), CCC = 0.953]. Proportions of mean squared prediction error attributable to mean and linear bias and random error were 10.6, 2.2, and 87.2% for the Molly model, and 1.3, 0.3, and 98.6% for the Karoline model, respectively. Mean and linear bias were significant for the Molly model but not for the Karoline model. With the mixed model regression analysis RMSPE adjusted for random study effects were 10.9 and 7.9% for the Molly model and the Karoline model, respectively. The residuals of CH 4  predictions were more strongly related to factors associated with CH 4  production (feeding level, digestibility, fat concentrations) with the Molly model compared with the Karoline model. Especially large mean (underprediction) and linear bias (overprediction of low digestibility diets relative to high digestibility diets) contributed to the prediction error of CH 4  yield with the Molly model. It was concluded that both models could be used for prediction of CH 4  production in cattle, but Karoline was more accurate and precise based on smaller RMSPE, mean bias, and slope bias, and greater CCC. The importance of accurate input data of key variables affecting diet digestibility is emphasized.",
    "summary": "This paper evaluates the predictive performance of 2 mechanistic rumen models, Molly and Karoline, for methane (CH4) production in growing and dairy cattle. Using 267 treatment means from 55 respiration chamber studies, the authors regress observed CH4 production on model-predicted CH4 (pCH4) and organic matter digestibility (pOMD). Several linear regression equations relate observed CH4 or OMD to the corresponding model predictions for each model, with reported RMSPE and percentage of observed mean to quantify accuracy. A generic mixed-effects regression equation describes how observed responses are related to predictions with fixed and random components. An RMSPE equation defines the goodness-of-fit metric used. Overall, Karoline yields smaller RMSPE and bias than Molly, indicating better agreement with observed methane production and digestibility across diverse dairy and growing cattle diets without CH4-mitigating additives.",

      "explanation": "This equation assesses how well Karoline predicts organic matter digestibility. The relatively high slope (0.79) and modest intercept (150), combined with very low RMSPE relative to the mean, indicate that Karoline captures digestibility patterns across diets with good fidelity, which is crucial because digestibility is a key driver of methane production.",
