    "summary": "This paper focuses on developing predictive models for enteric methane emissions in dairy cows. The main model (Eq. 1) is a linear regression equation that predicts daily methane emissions (CH₄, g/d) as a function of dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d) and dietary neutral detergent fiber concentration (NDF, % of DM). The model was developed using individual cow records and demonstrates good predictive performance (R² = 0.71) for lactating Holstein cows in freestall production systems.",
